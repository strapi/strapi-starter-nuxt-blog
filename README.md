## Getting started

The easiest way to try this starter is to run it locally on your computer.

First, you'll need to create your own copy of this starter. You can do so by clicking [the "Use this template" button](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-starter-nuxt-blog/generate) on GitHub, and filling the [form](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

### Backend

Create a Strapi project named `backend` using the [blog template](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-blog):

```
# Using Yarn
yarn create strapi-app backend --template https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-blog

# Or using NPM
npx create-strapi-app backend --template https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-blog
```

The Strapi server will automatically start and import sample seed data.

### Frontend

Leave the Strapi backend running in the background. Open another terminal tab, and make sure you're in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies and start the Nuxt server:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn install
yarn develop

# Using npm
npm install
npm run develop
```


If you want to change the default environment variables, create a `.env` file like this:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

The Nuxt server will run here => [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Enjoy this starter!
